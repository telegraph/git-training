# Exercise 1 - Setting up Git and Creating a Repo

## First Add your name and email to your local Git Config

$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
$ git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com

Sign up for a GitHub account if you haven't already: https://github.com/join

Create an SSH key, or verify you have an existing one that works: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/

1. Create a repo, give it a name - this can be anything you like, but don't use spaces or weird characters
2. Clone it
Add some files locally
Git add . to track them
Commit with a commit message
Push
Look on Github and see the changes and the commit message
