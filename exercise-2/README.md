# Exercise 2 - Working with Branches

Make a new branch locally
Push it and add it to the remote
Make some changes, commit and push it
See the result on github


Checkout the original master branch
Verify that the files are the same as the original branch and don’t have the changes in the new branch


Do a merge request for the new branch, to merge it to master
View the merge request in Github and the diff
Merge it on Github
See the result


Show an example of a merge conflict and how to resolve it (advanced and probably not required for Ops team tbh)

.gitignore file
DON’T put credentials or sensitive data in git/source control!
